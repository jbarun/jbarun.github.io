This project was made during a week of education at PISMO Novska in 2021. A 2D platformer parody game in which you play as a stereotypical Balkan man on his way to earn enough money to pay the bills and win back his girlfriend. My role in the game development process was to be the Project Manager and Game Designer, making sure everything felt the way it should while writing the story and coming up with different mechanics and ways of integrating them into the project.

This project was made during a four-day Game Jam during education at PISMO Novska in 2021. A hyper-casual 2D puzzle reflex/ reaction game that colorfully depicts the process of pollination.  The game was designed for mobile devices, meant to be played by all, although the reaction time required for greater scores makes it more suitable for younger audiences.
