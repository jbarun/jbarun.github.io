This project was made during a four-day Game Jam during education at PISMO Novska in 2021. A hyper-casual 2D puzzle reflex/ reaction game that colorfully depicts the process of pollination, for which I worked as Project Manager. The game was designed for mobile devices, meant to be played by all, although the reaction time required for greater scores makes it more suitable for younger audiences.
